# Gibbon Hug

I'm very bad at writing about pages. I chose the username 'gibbonhug' because I think gibbons are funny looking animals. Lots of pictures of them hugging online. 'gibbonhug' also sounds a bit like 'github' so that was probably a subconscious factor.

I'm currently making my way through the Odin project. I am a CS undergrad in Atlanta, Georgia.

I used to correct other people's misspellings on virtual pet site forums a long time ago. This being considered a 'contribution to open source' now woke that part of me up, so I might make silly PRs for tiny grammar/spelling things. Sorry.

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/gibbonhug), although I'm not much of a social media person and haven't posted there yet.
